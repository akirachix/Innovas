## ABOUT
#### The project is an alert system that aims to identify the possible dangers in the forest by continuously recording the noise in the forest, processing segments of the recorded signals, and deciding upon the nature of each of the segments. The system will implement an algorithm able to isolate the audio signal corresponding to cutting wood material ( e.g, by using a chainsaw) eventually, the system will produce an alarm to register the specific location where the event was detected. Alarms will then notify the authorities and notify them to take action to prevent deforestation. The project seeks to minimize deforestation in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and alleviate the consequences of global warming.
